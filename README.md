🧩 In short: SQL = Universal language for retrieving and managing data from the database.
🧩 In short: T-SQL = SQL + Programming power (especially valid for SQL Server).
Why Is It Important for Data Science?
Data scientists directly access databases to:

Prepare data (cleaning, filtering),

Extract meaningful information from large data sets,

Prepare data for analysis for modeling.

This often requires knowledge of SQL (and T-SQL if using SQL Server).

🔍 Why Is It Important?

Data is mostly stored in databases (for example: customer data, sales, clicks).

Tools such as Python, R, and Excel can be integrated with SQL.

Quick access and filtering of data is possible with SQL.
